`kokaq-core` is the heart of `kokaq`, a distributed, cloud-native priority queue implementation. It provides the foundational logic and data structures for enabling true, weight-based prioritization across distributed systems.

# ✨ Key Features
- 📊 True priority support — Weight-based ordering with deterministic dequeueing
- ⚙️ Lightweight core — Pure logic with no external dependencies
- 🧵 Concurrency-aware — Built to scale across distributed workers
- 📦 Modular — Can be embedded into larger systems or composed into services
